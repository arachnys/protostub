# protostub ![ci badge](https://travis-ci.org/arachnys/protostub.svg?branch=master)

A tool for generating Mypy type stubs from a Protocol Buffer definition.

## Building

### Requirements
- Go
- make (optional)


### With go get
If you already have Go all setup in your `PATH`, then it is as simple as:

```
go get github.com/arachnys/protostub/cmd/protostub
```

### With Make
This approach might be best if you're less familiar with Go, and want it to 
*just work*. It requires no messing with `$GOPATH`.

```
git clone https://github.com/arachnys/protostub
cd protostub
make
```

The protostub binary should be in the `bin` folder.

## Usage
Assuming that you have a `.proto` file called `foo.proto` and you want to 
generate a `.pyi` file from it, usage is as such:

```
protostub generate --proto foo.proto
```

In this case, protostub assumes you want to call your stub `foo_pb2.pyi`. If 
this is not the case, or perhaps you want to specify a different directory, the 
output can be specified like so:

```
protostub generate --proto foo.proto --mypy bar.pyi
```

Help is included in the tool:

```
Generate Mypy type stubs from Protobuf definitions

Usage:
  protostub [command]

Available Commands:
  generate    Generate a stub from a given proto file
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for protostub

Use "protostub [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Using the stubs
If you've tried using mypy in your project, you've probably noticed that it does
not do anything for protobuf types. This is because the generated python contains
nothing that Mypy can use - classes are not defined in the "normal" way.

We currently use a script to generate a list of files for Mypy to check. If the 
`.py` file has a corresponding `.pyi` file, then the `.py` is ignored. Otherwise
it is used. This allows us to override any Python with a type stub, meaning we
can override Python generated by `protoc` with something generated by `protostub`,
and get functioning type checks!

An alternative would be to invoke Mypy on a module rather than on files, and 
provide the stubs in `MYPYPATH`. However, I have not tested this, so I don't know
how well it works.
